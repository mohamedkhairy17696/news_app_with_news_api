# news_app
In this project, I used Google news API. I used state management "Bloc". I used the DIO package for handling API. In this app, I used the bottom navigation bar to navigate between screens. and I used the "WebView" package to show news on the web view on a new screen. and I used a search screen that you can search for anything on google news.
